      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When I say the phrase "Ludonarrative dissonance" what comes to your mind. If you thought to yourself, 
        "gee that sure is a funny word, I wonder what it means," or maybe " hey, that's the fancy word game 
        journalists use to sound smart," then it would probably be useful to know what it actually means, 
        and why it is actually relevant to the field of game design and review. In fact, there are many such
        terms within that industry which are thrown around as if you're supposed to know what you mean. 
        For example, what's the difference between a rogue-like and a rogue-lite? You can find these definitions
        online, but unfortunately they are scattered about the distant corners of the web. My goal is to create 
        a dictionary/repository where all of this information can easily be accessed and referenced, 
        kind of like a wiki.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>People looking to get into game analysis and design, as well as those
        trying to discover differences between game genres.

      <h3>Genres</h3>
      <p>
        Genres:
1.	Fighting Games: A game genre defined by player vs. player gameplay
2.	Metroidvania: A style of game which largely focuses on exploring an interconnected maze-like world, while gaining abilities that allow fur further exploration. The term itself comes from the game series Metroid and Castlevania, which are some of the earliest examples of this style of game. Some more modern examples include games such as Hollow Knight, Axiom Verge, Metroid Dread, and Ori and the Blind Forest.
3.	Rogue-likes: A genre in which the player starts from the beginning each time, but the levels, enemies, and upgrades are randomized to some extent. A Rogue-lite is a member of this genre in which certain attributes or unlocks carry over from previous runs.
4.	Platformers: A genre based around the maneuvering of the character through an environment. Subgenres are defined by whether the game is 2D or 3D, and what the ultimate goal of the game is
5.	RPG: Role-playing game. In these games, the player assumes the role of someone within a fictional world. Dungeons and Dragons is the classic example of this style and is in fact the direct inspiration for many of early games within this genre. As such, statistics that can be improved usually play a large function within these games.
a.	Turn-Based RPG: A style of RPG in which two sides take turns picking attacks.
b.	Action RPG: A style of RPG in which combat takes place in real time.
c.	Western RPG: Generally, RPGs made in the West are known for their freedom in player expression, usually through character customization and narrative choices.
d.	JRPG: Japanese role-playing game. This subgenre may be defined by it’s country of origin, but as time as gone on it is largely used to apply to RPGs with a bigger emphasis on a set narrative story.
6.	Grand Strategy/4X: If you think Risk is overly complicated and drawn out, than you have much more to learn about just how far games can go in this respect.

      <h3>Gaming Terms</h3>
      <p>
        General terms:
1.	FPS: frames per second. This is how many times the computer updates the display. Generally, the more frames per second, the smoother the gameplay looks and feels.
2.	DLC: Downloadable Content: This refers to content released separately from the main game, but which can be downloaded by the player, sometimes with an additional cost. This can vary from simple aesthetic changes like emotes and costumes (widely referred to as skins), to full expansions that can rival the size of the entire base game.

	Fighting Games:
1.	Hit/Hurt boxes: In games a hit box refers to the area in which an attack will connect with another character and deal damage. A hurt box is the part of a character which can be hit with such an attack. These are traditionally created using boxes that affect each other when they collide, although other shapes can be used as well.
2.	Frame Data: This refers to the number of frames that an attack has, or how quickly a certain option will come out. It can also refer to the amount of frames it takes for the player to return to their neutral position from their attacking position. This is generally referred to as recovery frames.
3.	Buffs and Nerfs: A buff is used to refer to when a character receives a strengthened attribute with a newer version(patch) of the game. A nerf is when an attribute is weakened. These are generally changes made by the game’s developers in order to try and balance the game.
RPGs:
1.	HP: Hit Points. This refers to the amount of damage a character or object can take before becoming incapacitated and/or killed. For more information on the origin of the term and how it is applied today, I recommend checking out <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jcxc-ddWKI”this> video.
2.	DPS: Damage per Second: How quickly something or someone can deal out damage to foes. It’s also used to refer to classes whose main role is to damage enemies.
3.	Tank: Tanking refers to when a player purposefully takes damage. It’s also used to refer to classes whose main purpose is to draw away enemy attack from their allies and instead towards themselves.
4.	Buffs/Debuffs: Effects that increase or decrease a character’s abilities/statistics.
5.	Aggro: Short for aggression, aggro is usually used in reference to how an enemy AI determines who to attack.
