            <h1>Words to Know</h1>
            <h3>Standard words used in basic communication</h3>
            <button class="term-class">General Terms</button>
            <section class="panel">
                <h3>Buff/Nerf</h3>
                <p>
                    A buff is used to refer to when a character receives a strengthened attribute with a newer 
                    version(patch) of the game. A nerf is when an attribute is weakened. These are generally 
                    changes made by the game's developers in order to try and balance the game.
                </p>
                <h3>Tank</h3>
                <p>
                    Tanking refers to when a player purposefully takes damage. It's also used to refer to classes 
                    whose main purpose is to draw away enemy attacks from their allies and instead towards 
                    themselves.
                </p>
                <h3>Aggro</h3>
                <p>
                    Short for aggression, aggro is usually used in reference to how an enemy AI determines 
                    who to attack.
                </p>
                <h3>Hit/Hurt Boxes</h3>
                <p>
                    In games a hit box refers to the area in which an attack will connect with another character 
                    and deal damage. A hurt box is the part of a character which can be hit with such an attack. 
                    These are traditionally visualized using boxes, but other shapes can be used as well.

                <h3>HP</h3>
                <p>
                    Hit Points. This refers to the amount of damage a character or object can take before becoming 
                    incapacitated and/or killed. For more information on the origin of the term and how it is 
                    applied today, I recommend checking out 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jcxc-ddWKI" target="_blank">this</a> video.

                <h3>DPS</h3>
                <p>
                    Damage per Second: How quickly something or someone can deal out damage to foes. 
                    It is also used to refer to classes whose main role is to damage enemies.
                </p>
                <h3>GG</h3>
                <p>
                    Good Game. Used after a match to indicate that you had a good time or as good sportsmanship.
                </p>
                <h3>DLC</h3>
                <p>
                    Downloadable Content: This refers to content released separately from the main game which can 
                    be downloaded by the player, sometimes with an additional cost. This can vary from simple 
                    aesthetic changes like emotes and costumes (widely referred to as skins), to full expansions 
                    that can rival the size of the entire base game.
                </p>
                <h3>FPS</h3>
                <p>
                    Frames per second. This is how many times the computer updates the display. Generally, 
                    the more frames per second, the smoother the gameplay looks and feels.
