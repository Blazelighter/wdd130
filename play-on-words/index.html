            <h1>Play On Words</h1>
            <h2>A beginners guide to the modern gaming vernacular</h2>
            <p>When I say the phrase "Ludonarrative dissonance" what comes to your mind. If you thought to yourself, 
                "gee that sure is a funny word, I wonder what it means," or maybe " hey, that's the fancy word game 
                journalists use to sound smart," then it would probably be useful to know what it actually means, 
                and why it is actually relevant to the field of game design and review. In fact, there are many 
                such terms within that industry which are thrown around as if you're supposed to know what you 
                mean. For example, what's the difference between a rogue-like and a rogue-lite? You can find these 
                definitions online, but unfortunately they are scattered about the distant corners of the web. 
                The point of this website is to create a dictionary/repository where all of this information can 
                easily be accessed and referenced, kind of like a wiki. </p>
